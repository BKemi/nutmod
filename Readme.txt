Readme for the nutmod R project
The goal of this R project is to provide estimates of the nutritional consequences of changes arising in scenarios of both socioeconomic and climate futures. It integrates data from 
* FAOÕs Food Balance Sheets, 
* the Shared Socioeconomic Profiles used in the IPCCÕs Fifth Assessment Report and many other studies, 
* quantitative scenario modeling results from IFPRIÕs IMPACT model
* a lookup table that is used to convert food consumption by a representative consumer in a country (including optionally a measure of nutrient loss during food preparation) to it macro and micro constituents
* age- and gender-adjusted nutrient requirements.
The directory hierarchy of the project is as follows. Second level directories are in parentheses:
* data (IMPACTData) Ð contains .xlsx and .rds files generated by the dataPrep and dataManagement R scripts
* data-raw (FBSData, IMPACTData, NutrientData, SSPData) Ð data files from FAO, SSP, IMPACT, the nutrient lookup table
* R Ð R scripts
* Results Ð results from the analysis, contains .xlsx and .rds files
All R code is in the R directory. File naming conventions are:
* dataPrep.xxx.R Ð reads in the raw data from the data-raw directory and processes it into .rds (and sometimes .xlsx) files and writes these to the data or IMPACTData directory
* dataManagement.xxx.R Ð reads in .rds data files from the data or IMPACTData directory, does more processing and writes writes these to the data or IMPACTData directory.
* xxxFunctions.R Ð has generic functions used in the xxx R scripts. A special functions script is nutrientModFunctions.R. In addition to R functions it holds the names of key variables such as file names and directory paths. All other scripts read this information in with functions from this script.
* nutrientCalcs.R Ð all final calculations are (currently) done in this script.
