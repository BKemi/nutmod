<h1>Dietary diversity, nutrient availability by food group, draft</h1>
<p>July 21, 2016</p>
<p>Diversity of food consumption is considered by nutritionists to be an important component of a healthy diet. Elements of diversity include diversity of food intake within a day, across several days, for the average diet. And it includes diversity of individual food items as well as from food groups and staples and non-staples. The data available for this analysis only allows for selected diversity measures.</p>
<p>A second diversity measure we use is the share of a nutrient consumed from different food groups.</p>
