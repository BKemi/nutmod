<p>The IMPACT model generates consumer prices for IMPACT commodities that the average consumer might consume. Expenditure on an individual commodity is just its consumer price times the quantity available to the average consumer. Summing across all commodities gives total expenditure on the food items available.</p>
<p>This tab reports the share of per capita income that total expenditure accounts for. Note that the results for fish and alcohol consumption are not included in this calculation because the current version of IMPACT doesn&rsquo;t generate prices for the food items in these food groups.</p>
<p>The table below reports per capita income and consumption expenditure in million ppp US$; the last column is the ratio of the two.</p>
