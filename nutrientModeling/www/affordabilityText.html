<p>The IMPACT model generates consumer prices for IMPACT commodities that the average consumer might consume. Expenditure on an individual commodity is just its consumer price times the quantity available to the average consumer. Summing across all commodities gives total expenditure on the food items available.</p>
<p>This table below reports per capita GDP (in million PPP dollars) and the share of per capita income that total expenditure accounts for. Note that consumption of fish and alcoholic beverages is not included in this calculation because the current version of IMPACT doesn&rsquo;t generate prices for the food items in these food groups.</p>
