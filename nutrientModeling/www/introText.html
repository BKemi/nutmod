<h1>Introduction to the Nutrient Modeling Website</h1>
<p>Draft, August 2, 2016</p>
<p>This website presents detailed, country-specific information on nutrient availability, affordability and dietary diversity for scenarios to 2050.</p>
<p>It is based on research that will be published in two papers -- one substantive and one technical that includes the code and data. The tentative titles are</p>
<ul>
<li>Global nutrition security: relative threats from climate change and demand growth</li>
<li>Modeling nutrition security scenarios: Description of the technical process</li>
</ul>
<p>The website, and the results, are currently in development, and are likely to vary each time it is visited. Please treat this as work-in-progress and do not share. If you find something that seems wrong or is questionable, please email Gerald Nelson at <a href="mailto:nelson.gerald.c@gmail.com">nelson.gerald.c@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>The website has a tabbed interface; one tab for each topic.</p>
<p>The current/planned tabs are</p>
<ul>
<li>Affordability</li>
<li>Adequacy</li>
<li>Dietary diversity, Shannon Diversity index</li>
<li>Dietary diversity, food group share of nutrient availability</li>
<li>Meta data for the project, mainly for developers</li>
<li>Meta data for the IMPACT inputs, mainly for developers</li>
</ul>
