<h1>Modeling dietary adequacy: ratios of nutrient availability to requirements</h1>
<p>Draft, August 2, 2016</p>
<p>This tab presents ratios of nutrient availability relative to two Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) standards:</p>
<p>The measure of recommended amount is the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) or the Adequate Intake (AI) for nutrients that do not have an RDA. This tab also reports on availability relative to the Upper Limit (UL) of recommended daily intake, which is the highest level of chronic intake that is unlikely to cause adverse health effects. Both a spider diagram for each set of requirements and the underlying data used to construct the spider diagram are shown.‚Äù</p>
