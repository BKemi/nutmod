<h1>Modeling dietary adequacy: nutrient availability to requirements ratios</h1>
<p>Draft, August 2, 2016</p>
<p>This tab presents ratios of nutrient availability relative to recommended amounts and to tolerable upper limits.</p>
<p>The measure of recommended amount is the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for most nutrients and Adequate Intake (AI) values for the remainder. This tab also reports on availability relative to the upper limit of recommended consumption of nutrients for which overconsumption can be harmful. Both a spider diagram for each set of requirements and the underlying data used to construct the spider diagram are shown.</p>
